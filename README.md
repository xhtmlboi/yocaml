# YOCaml

> YOCaml is framework for building static site generator, written in
> OCaml.

You will find a comprehensive tutorial on how to use YOCaml on the
[official website](https://yocaml.github.io/tutorial).

## Dev setup

We suggest creating a local switch to create a sandboxed development
environment.

```ocaml
opam update
opam switch create . --deps-only --with-doc --with-test --with-dev-setup -y
eval $(opam env)
```

When the environment is prepared, `dune build` should build the project.

### Useful commands

- `dune fmt` Format the entire code base according to the profile described in the `.ocamlformat` file.
- `dune test` Run the tests (for expectation tests, following the command with `dune promote` will regenerate the tests that produce outputs)

> Ensure that you have run `dune fmt` and `dune test` before waiting
> for your branch to be merged.
